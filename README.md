# thumbnail-carousel

React component library that provides a carousel with a wide range of options.

### Use Case

If you want to display multiple images/videos inside of a single carousel, this package will do that for you.  It's not recommended to use this package if the videos are large in size or bandwidth is a concern, since this package uses `<video>` and `<img>` tags to display items.

### Getting starting



### Examples

The [story book](https://beschuetzer.github.io/thumbnail-carousel/?path=/docs/thumbnail-carousel-layout--docs) is the best way to learn about customization options.
