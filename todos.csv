Before Publishing
  -round the spacing for items and the translate amount to ensure no cuttof (then can add half the diff as padding-left)
  -make 0 be default padding top for carousel
  -figure out issue with translate amount for navigation items
  -finish readme 
  -make gifs for some common examples in readme
  -add .mdx files for each story file (google), with details on how to test (e.g. dynamic layout)
  -write jest tests for utils and other functions?
  -create a CI/CD 

Enhancements
  -add logic to only render the items on the current page + next page?
  -add volume button for videos?
  -add text sizing for modal header and item-viewer-toolbar-container (the width of the spans will need to adjust accordingly too) so that mobile looks more like fullscreen (a fixed ratio with a min of 8 or something?)
  -replace all inline styles with classname variables (heavy lift)?
  -check how fullscreen looks on phone (should rotate)
  -add a single option for full width single item per page with only circular buttons
  -make CarouselElementCustomization.style a CarouselElementValue?
  -when done with buttonSize stuff, clean up css styles
  -how to intelligently add themes or default colors?

  -add a colors.scss and pick an actual color design and refactor all colors to use it (use custom properties too to make customizable?); name `color1`, `color2`, etc?
  -figure out how to memoize options and styling logic (e.g. when playing a video, the styling getters run each time)
  -add lazy loading of items (only render the items up to the furtherst currentPage)?
  -update all custom test case
  -figure out how to test and implement accessability
  -verify all of the progress bar customization options still work when done 
  -restructure the options object to make things like the progressbar options more accesible (currently in styling.toolbar.progressBar)?  Mabye have an options.elements where all elements are listed?

Known Issues:
  -specifying a border string value using millimeters or rem may result in the current item's size being incorrectly calculated, especially when using floats
  -having more than 10 instance on the same page can cause issues (need to benchmark this)?
  -small gap at bottom of toolbar (only appears a smaller viewports around 845px)
  -changing items with mid-tier and below setting is sluggish
  -CarouselElementValue only updates when CarouselContent re-renders; if dynamic spacing is on, then re-renders occur much more often
  -cursor only changes properly after going into full screen once
